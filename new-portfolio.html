                rise, don't look outside yourself. Look inside. Don't let your fears keep you mired in the crowd.
                Abolish your fears and raise your commitment level to the point of no return, and I guarantee you that
                the Champion Within will burst forth to propel you toward victory.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>What is mission? I think mission means achieve our aim.It would be very difficult for all. But everyone
                should stay focused towards to finish their mission.Most of the people can't achieve it because they
                didn't stay and if you work hard you can.Mission statement core activities and tangible objectives today

            <p>What is vision? I think vission means what allows you to see the world around you. You have vision thanks
                to several components within your eye and brain that work together.Vision statement reason for being now
                and in the future</p>
